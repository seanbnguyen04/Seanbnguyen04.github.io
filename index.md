## favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, Part 1
  
  This is my first favorite lab because we learned how to convert volume. I was able to learn how to accurately declare and initialize double to the conversion ratios between the units of measurements that was required of me to use from the readme file. It was confusing at first but with the help of my teammates and instructors it went smoothly.

* Lab 8, Part 1
  
  This was my second favorite lab because the coding consisted of if statements and initializing variables to output our food order. This lab helped me with learning how to use different variables and initializing it with arguments. It also helped me with learning to properly code my output. The context of the assignment made it very simple and fun.

* Lab 10, Part 1
  
  This is the third lab, I enjoyed this assignment since it requires the use of the lowest and highest number being used in part of the coding to finish it. What I learned from this lab was how to compute the maximum and minimum. With this lab, there were some struggles of how to do certain steps but ended well.
